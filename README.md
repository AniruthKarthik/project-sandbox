# Mini Projects & Prototypes

This repository serves as an archive of small-scale projects, experimental prototypes, and technical explorations.  
Each project reflects a specific idea or technical curiosity, some of which were discontinued due to practical limitations or redundancy with existing solutions.

> These projects are not actively maintained. They are preserved here for reference, learning, and potential future rework.
