# ImgSearch

Content-Based Image Search Prototype

## Overview

ImgSearch was a proof-of-concept prototype that explored basic techniques for content-based image retrieval.  
The idea was to extract metadata from images—such as objects, colors, and layout—and allow search via tags or natural language queries.

## Challenges & Closure

While the prototype demonstrated feasibility, the space is already well-served by commercial solutions (e.g., Google Photos, Apple Photos) with advanced machine learning capabilities.  
As a result, this project was marked as complete and archived.

## Status

**Closed** – Superseded by existing commercial tools with broader capabilities.
